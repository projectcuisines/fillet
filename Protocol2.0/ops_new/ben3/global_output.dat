# Name of benchmark/experiment: Benchmark 3
# Describe how ice line latitude is determined: The surface ice coverage corresponds to latitude bands in which the annually-averaged surface temperature is < 263.15 K.

# Columns of data
# Case = case number (0 -> total number of cases in experiment)
# Inst = instellation (S_earth; i.e., relative to Earth's 1361 W m^-2)
# Obl = obliquity (degrees)
# XCO2 = mixing ratio (volume) of CO2 (ppm)
# Tglob = global, annual mean surface temperature (K)
# IceLineN = latitude of ice line in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineS = latitude of ice line in southern hemisphere (deg)
