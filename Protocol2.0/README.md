## Scripts and Data to Generate Model Intercomparison Figures

Each model has its own directory that should contain subdirectories for each benchmark and experiment. To be compliant with the Protocol, each directory must adhere to the following structure:

```
CodeName/
├-- ben1
    ├-- case_0
    |   ├-- lat_output.dat
    └-- global_output.dat
