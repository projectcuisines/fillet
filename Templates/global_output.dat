# Use this header for notes about experiment set up

# Name of benchmark/experiment:
# Describe how ice line latitude is determined:

# Columns of data:
# Case = case number (0 -> total number of cases in experiment)
# Inst = instellation (S_earth; i.e., relative to Earth's 1361 W m^-2)
# Obl = obliquity (degrees)
# XCO2 = mixing ratio (volume) of CO2 (ppm)
# Tglob =  annual mean global surface temperature (K)
# IceLineNMaxLand = latitude of northern edge of ice on land in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineNMinLand = latitude of northern edge of ice on land in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineNMaxSea = latitude of northern edge of ice on the sea in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineNMinSea = latitude of northern edge of ice on the sea in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineSMaxLand = latitude of southern edge of ice on land in southern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineSMinLand = latitude of southern edge of ice on land in southern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineSMaxSea = latitude of southern edge of ice on the sea in southern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineSMinSea = latitude of southern edge of ice on the sea in southern hemisphere (deg)
# Diff = diffusion coefficient
# OLR = global, annual mean outgoing longwave radiation

# Examples for the different surface ice states (using the suffixes Land and Sea where appropriate):
# Polar caps: IceLineNMax = 90, IceLineNMin = 60, IceLineSMax = -60, IceLineSMin = -90
# Snowball state: IceLineNMax = 90, IceLineNMin = 0, IceLineSMax = 0, IceLineSMin = -90
# Ice free state: IceLineNMax = 90, IceLineNMin = 90, IceLineSMax = -90, IceLineSMin = -90
# Ice belt in northern hemisphere: IceLineNMax = 30, IceLineNMin = 15, IceLineSMax = -90, IceLineSMin = -90 
# Ice belt that spans equator: IceLineNMax = 30, IceLineNMin = 0, IceLineSMax = 0, IceLineSMin = -30

# Each row represents a moment in time and all columns must be the same length
