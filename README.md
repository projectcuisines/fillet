Welcome! You've found the hompage of the FILLET Project! We're comparing one dimensional
energy balance models (EBMs) that have been applied to habitable exoplanets. The project 
began in 2022 and we've published one paper that describes Protocol 1. We're currently 
comparing the following codes: ESTM, HEXTOR, Kadoya-Tajika, OPS, PlaHab, Shields-Bitz, and VPLanet.
